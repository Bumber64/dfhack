This command can refresh the grass (or subterranean moss) growing on your map.
It will only regrow the grass and moss on tiles that had some to begin with.

Usage
-----

::

    regrass [max]

Specify the ``max`` keyword to pack more grass/moss onto a tile than what the
game normally allows. This will give your grazers extra chewing time.
